            Irvin Lawson Fiscus (June 28, 1866 – August 31, 1949) was one of the first professional football players. He attended Princeton University, where his outstanding play at offensive guard earned him the title Samson of Princeton, before going on to play professionally with the Allegheny Athletic Association in 1891 and the Greensburg Athletic Association in 1893. His brothers Ross and Newell also played for Pittsburgh-area athletic clubs and were highly regarded as players.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life ==<br/><br/>Lawson was the son of a farmer and he grew up in Indiana County, Pennsylvania. He was just one of sixteen children. All of his brothers were athletic and largely built, however Lawson was considered the toughest of family.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Football ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Princeton ===<br/><br/>Lawson may have played some informal football at Indiana Normal School (now Indiana University of Pennsylvania) in the late 1880s. By 1891, he and Ross played well enough to receive "liberal expense money" to go to Pittsburgh and play for the Allegheny Athletic Association. In 1892, Lawson was recruited to play football at Princeton University. At the time, college football was considered more prestigious than professional football.
