            Laodice IV (flourished second half 3rd century BC and first half 2nd century BC) was a Greek princess, head priestess and a queen of the Seleucid Empire. Antiochus III appointed Laodice in 193 BC, as the chief priestess of the state cult dedicated to her mother Laodice III in Media. She later was married to three kings of the Seleucid Empire  --all her brothers.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Biography ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Family and early life ===<br/><br/>She was one of the daughters and among the children born to the Seleucid Monarchs Antiochus III the Great and Laodice III. Her paternal grandparents were the former Seleucid Monarchs Seleucus II Callinicus and Laodice II, while her maternal grandparents were King Mithridates II of Pontus and his wife Laodice.<br/><br/>The parents of Laodice IV were first cousins, because her paternal grandfather and her maternal grandmother were brother and sister, and were among the children of Antiochus II Theos and Laodice I. She was born and raised in the Seleucid Empire. Laodice was commemorated with an honorific inscription dedicated to her at Delos.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>==== Ancestry ====<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== First tenure as queen consort ===<br/><br/>In 196 BC, her eldest brother, crown prince Antiochus, was appointed by her father to succeed him. In that year Laodice was married to him. The marriage of Laodice IV and Antiochus was the first sibling marriage to occur in the Seleucid dynasty. From their sibling union Laodice IV bore Antiochus a daughter called Nysa.
