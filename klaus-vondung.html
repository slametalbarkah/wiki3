            Klaus Vondung (born 16 July 1941) is a German scholar in the fields of cultural and German studies. The focus of his academic work lies in the interplay of literature, politics and religion during the German Empire, Nazi Germany and beyond.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life and education ==<br/><br/>Klaus Vondung was born in Ulm. He studied German, history, philosophy and politics at University of Tübingen and Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (LMU), where he passed the Staatsexamen during the winter semester of 1965/66. Three years later he received the Doctor of Philosophy (Dr. phil.) degree fromf LMU and spent the next two years as a lecturer. Having been granted a scholarship from the German Research Foundation, he spent two years of post-graduate research at Stanford University.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Academic work as a professor ==<br/><br/>Following a habilitation about the more recent history of German literature, Klaus Vondung was appointed a professor of German studies and literature at the University of Siegen in 1976, a post which he held until becoming an emeritus in 2006. During his time in Siegen, he also served at times as dean and prorector (Vice President).<br/><br/>Vondung's academic research interests are expressed by the premise of the graduate school "Forms of Communication as Forms of Life", of which he was the speaker.
