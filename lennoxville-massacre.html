            The Lennoxville massacre, or Lennoxville purge, was a mass murder which took place at the Hells Angels clubhouse in Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada, on March 24, 1985. Five members of the Hells Angels North Chapter, were shot dead. The North Chapter was led by 2 of its original and most influential members Laurent "L'Anglais" Viau and Yves "Apache" Trudeau. The Lennoxville Massacre divided rival outlaw motorcycle gangs in Quebec, leading to the formation of the Rock Machine club in 1986, a rival to the Angels in the 1990s. The name "Lennoxville massacre" is a misnomer since the killings took place in Sherbrooke. The misconception that the killings took place in Lennoxville arose from the fact the victims had stayed and partied at a motel in Lennoxville before they went to the Sherbrooke clubhouse.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Background ==<br/><br/>Beginning in the 1960s, one of Montreal's more prominent biker gangs were the Popeyes Motorcycle Club, who were led by Yves "Le Boss" Buteau. In the 1970s, the Popeyes had successfully fought against the Devils Diciples and Satan's Choice biker gangs, and as the journalist Patrick Lejtenyi noted: "The violence that ensued cemented Quebec's reputation as one of the most dangerous places for organized crime to do business in North America." Journalist James Dubro told Lejtenyi: "There's always has been more violence in Quebec. In the biker world it's known as the Red Zone. I remember an Outlaws hit man telling me he was scared of going to Montreal." The Hells Angels, who had been looking to expand into Canada, decided that the Popeyes were the best gang to take into their organization.
