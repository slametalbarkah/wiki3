            Ketamine-assisted psychotherapy is the use of prescribed doses of ketamine, an analgesic anesthetic with dissociative properties, in combination with psychotherapy for treatment of various psychiatric conditions. Ketamine-assisted psychotherapy shows potential in treating mental disorders including major depressive disorder, anxiety, obsessive–compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorders, substance use disorder, and neuropathic pain. Despite initial usage as a rapid-acting antidepressant, its psychedelic effects have sparked interest in its potential for treatment of mental illnesses beyond depressive symptoms. Ketamine appears to offer promising results as an effective modality of treatment for a variety of mental conditions and was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States for usage in treatment-resistant depression, but does display areas in need of further research across different domains of mental illness.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Background ==<br/><br/>Ketamine is a short-acting, noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that was discovered by Parke-Davis Labs and Dr. Calvin Lee Stevens in 1962 during research into derivatives of phencyclidine (PCP). It was first used clinically as a veterinary anesthetic that was first given to a human in 1964 as a potential replacement for PCP. Soon after, Parke-Davis filed a patent for the utilization of the anesthetic. With this patent, ketamine began to be used on the battlefield where it was considered the "buddy drug" because soldiers were able to administer it to one another. Given its hallucinogenic properties, interest rapidly rose in the possibility of broader avenues of application, including within the field of psychiatry as a treatment for depression, substance use dependence, and more. Thus, soon after discovery, ketamine has been used as an off-label medication for a diverse group of psychiatric symptoms across Europe and the United States, and a topic of robust investigation.
