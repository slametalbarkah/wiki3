            La novillada (English: Young Bulls Race), is an oil painting by Francisco de Goya, painted in 1780, when he was trying his hand at bullfighting. It is part of the fourth series of tapestry cartoons for the Prince of Asturias' antechamber in the Pardo Palace.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Context ==<br/><br/>Goya was an aficionado, and frequented the world of bullfighting, considered at the time to be "the refuge of scoundrels where ruffians and adventurers are at ease". He describes La Novillada as a cape pass involving several young men, but does not name himself along them, even though he more or less portrayed himself. He subsequently painted several portraits of bullfighters, the best-known of which is that of Pedro Romero.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>All the paintings in the fourth series were destined for the antechamber of the Prince of Asturias, the future Charles IV and his wife Marie Louise de Parme, in the Pardo palace. The painting was delivered to the Royal Tapestry Factory on January 24, 1780 and received by its director, Cornelio Vandergoten. A document dated October 2, 1777, whose provenance is unknown, states that the La Novillada tapestry was to hang on the south wall of the princes' antechamber next to another tapestry: El Resguardo de tabacos.<br/><br/>It was considered lost until 1869, when the canvas was discovered in the basement of the Royal Palace in Madrid by Gregorio Cruzada Villaamil, and was returned to the Prado Museum in 1870 by the ordinances of January 19 and February 9, 1870, where it is exhibited in room 91. The painting was first mentioned in the Museo del Prado catalog in 1876.
