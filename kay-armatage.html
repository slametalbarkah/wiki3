<h1>Kay Armatage</h1>
            
            Kay Armatage (born 1943) is a Canadian filmmaker, former programmer at the Toronto International Film Festival and Professor emerita at the University of Toronto's Cinema Studies Institute and Women &amp; Gender Studies Institute. Though she attained a B.A. in English Literature from Queen's University, her name is generally linked with the University of Toronto.<br/><br/>Hailing from Saskatchewan, Armatage now lives in Toronto, Ontario. During her time as an international programmer at TIFF, Armatage worked hard to introduce audiences to female filmmakers and showed an affinity for risk-taking films. This tendency plays out in her films; Armatage makes feminist pieces that realist and experimental in form, usually documentaries. As a feminist filmmaker, Armatage makes observational films that speak to women's issues and challenges conventional filmmaking.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Career ==<br/><br/>Kay Armatage was an international programmer for the Toronto International Film Festival from 1982 to 2004, participating in a total of 23 TIFF’s. She has been praised for sticking up for Catherine Breillat’s Fat Girl (2001) when the board wanted to cut many scenes from the film for the festival in the name of censorship. Armatage has often argued for gender equality in filmmaking, and has stated that she believes that the goal for female filmmakers shouldn't just be to get to the halfway point, but to potentially exceed it.  Armatage is now on the Board of Directors of Women in View - an advocacy group for gender and diversity in Canadian media.
