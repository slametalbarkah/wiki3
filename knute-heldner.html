            Knute Heldner (1875 – November 5, 1952) was a Swedish-American artist.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Biography ==<br/><br/>Knute August Heldner was born in the village Vederslöv in Växjö Municipality, Kronoberg County, Sweden in 1875; some sources say 1877, or 1886 (also giving his first name as "Sven"). His early formal training was at Karlskrona Technical School and the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts in Stockholm. He migrated to the United States around 1902 and trained at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design in Minneapolis. He lived in Duluth, Minnesota until 1934. He was married to Collette Pope Heldner (1902–1990) who was also a painter and his one time student from the Rachel McFadden Art Studio in Duluth.<br/><br/>He won the gold medal at the Minnesota State Fair in 1915.  In 1921 he exhibited his work in the Swedish American Artist's Association in the Swedish Club of Chicago. His style was modern expressionistic, derived from his training as an artist in Sweden. He was recognized for painting of Louisiana landscapes.
