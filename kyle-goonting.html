<h1>Kyle Goonting</h1>
            
            Kyle Ezra Goonting (born 18 May 1988), also known by the nickname Be Wilder Beans, is a Malaysian film screenwriter, creative development, supervising and creative producer. He is currently the head of production &amp; development in Astro Shaw, the company he worked for since Polis Evo production. He is also one of the key people for the Polis Evo franchise alongside Joel Soh and Anwari Ashraf. He was also the co-creator and a founding member of Blackflag, a Malaysian film company managed by Soh.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Career ==<br/><br/>Goonting began his career in 2009 with the Astro Scholarship to University of New South Wales, or UNSW. In Australia, Kyle received a bachelor's in arts for film, cinema and video studies. In an interview with Astro Awani, Goonting told to Mariah Ahmad that he opened his eyes when he stays in Sydney for three years by learning more about Hollywood filmmaking.<br/><br/>After returned to Malaysia in 2012, he was appointed by Joel Soh to co-written Polis Evo with Soh himself and Anwari Ashraf. Goonting told Astro Awani about commitment by staffs in Polis Evo;<br/><br/><br/><br/>"I think the combination of all of them helped a lot to produce something extraordinary in this film. All parties try to give their best and if they do not succeed in reaching the desired level, they will be honest and try to improve it as best as possible. That's why if there is a scene that is not satisfactory, both the director, and the production crew and cast, they will try to redo it until it looks better."<br/><br/>In 2016, he co-created Malaysian production film company, Blackflag with Joel Soh and David Lin where he previously served as creative director until 2020.
