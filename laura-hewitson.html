She is an affiliate scientist at the Washington National Primate Research Center (WaNPRC) and an adjunct associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Additionally, she is the Research Director of the Johnson Center for Child Health and Development in Austin, Texas. Hewitson was a staff scientist at Oregon Health Sciences University from 1997 to 2001.
