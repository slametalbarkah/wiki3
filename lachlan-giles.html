            Lachlan Sven McDonald Giles (born 17 June 1986) is an Australian grappler and Brazilian jiu-jitsu (BJJ) black belt competitor and coach. He is a bronze medalist in both the ADCC Submission Wrestling World Championship and World No-Gi Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Championship.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life and education ==<br/><br/>Lachlan Giles was born on 17 June 1986, in Victoria, Australia.<br/><br/>Growing up he was a huge fan of Jet Li's martial arts movies and trained in Kung Fu initially. One year into his training he saw a tape of UFC 1 which was won by Royce Gracie. After watching the event, he was convinced that BJJ was the best form of self defense and shortly afterwards joined a BJJ academy to focus on it.<br/><br/>Giles’ first BJJ instructor was Tyrone Crosse who trained Giles from white to purple belt. However Giles suffered from a severe knee injury and was forced to stop his training for a year. When he returned, the academy had a new coach, John Simon. Simon promoted Giles to brown belt and in 2012 promoted him to black belt.
