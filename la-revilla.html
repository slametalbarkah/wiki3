<h1>LA Revilla</h1>
            
            Luis Alfonso Revilla (born November 30, 1989) is a Filipino former professional basketball player who played in the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA) and currently an assistant head coach for the UE Red Warriors.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== College career ==<br/><br/>Revilla, a San Beda Red Cub stalwart, was recruited by DLSU and suited up for the Green Archers in 2008. In his rookie season, he averaged 3.5 points, 1.7 rebounds, 1.9 assists, and 0.7 steals on 14.3 minutes per game, and was just a backup guard then to JVee Casio and Simon Atkins. His team lost to the Ateneo Blue Eagles in the UAAP Season 71 Finals. By the end of that season he was named a member of the league's All-Rookie team.<br/><br/>In summer of 2009, a few months before the opening of the UAAP's 72nd Season, he was diagnosed to have type 2 diabetes, a condition, which he said, runs in their family. This has prevented him from suiting up for La Salle for two seasons.<br/><br/>After two years, he returned to active competition in Season 74, and would become La Salle's top scorer and even the league's second leading point maker.  He finished the season with averages of 7.7 points, 3.7 assists and a league-leading 1.8 steals per game.<br/><br/>The next year, he would come on strong in Season 75, highlighted by 19 points in a double overtime loss to UST Growling Tigers in the first round, but things would then take a turn for the worse.
