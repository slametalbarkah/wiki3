            Kunchan Nambiar was a prominent Malayalam poet of the 18th century (1705-1770).  Apart from being a prolific poet, Nambiar is also famous as the originator of the dance art form of Thull'll, most of his works were written for use in Thullal performances.  Social criticism wrapped in humour is the hallmark of his works.  Nambiar is one of the foremost comedians in Malayalam.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Nambiar is believed to have been born at  Kalakkathu Veedu at Killikkurussimangalam in Palakkad district of the south Indian state of Kerala;. He spent his early childhood at Killikkurussimangalam, his boyhood at Kudamaloor and youth at Ambalappuzha, and learnt Kalaripayattu and Sanskrit from such masters as Mathoor Panickar, Dronaballi Naicker and Nannikod Unni Ravi Kurup, before moving to the court of Marthanda Varma of Travancore in 1748; later, he served at the court of his successor Dharma Raja. By the time he reached the royal court, he had already established himself as a poet. The later part of his life, it is believed that Nambiar returned to Ambalapuzha where he died in 1770, at the age of 65, reportedly due to rabies<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Career ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kunchan Nambiar is considered by many as the master of Malayalam satirist poetry and is credited with the popularisation of a performing art known as Ottan Thullal. The word, thullal, means 'dance/jumping', but under this name Nambiar developed a new style of verse narration, interspersed with occasional background music and dance-like swaying movements. Popular belief is that Nambiar devised this art form for avenging the ridicule he had to suffer from a Chakyar Koothu performer who chastised Nambiar when he dozed off while accompanying the koothu performance on Mizhavu.
