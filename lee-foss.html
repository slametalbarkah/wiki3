            Lee Foss is a record producer and DJ from DeKalb, Illinois. In addition to a number of releases on labels such as Culprit, Wolf+Lamb and No. 19, he co-founded the dance music label Hot Creations and is a member of the house music band Hot Natured alongside Jamie Jones, Ali Love and Luca C. He is also the founder of tech house record label, Repopulate Mars, and its sublabel, South of Saturn.<br/><br/>Foss's music is inspired by the musical heritage of Chicago and his influences include classic house, R&amp;B, 90s Hip Hop, 1980s electro and Detroit techno.<br/><br/>In 2010, Foss was the highest new entry into the Resident Advisor Top 100 DJ poll at no. 38, and climbed to no. 11 in 2011.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Career ==<br/><br/>While growing up in Chicago, Foss went to a lot of clubs and raves in the 1990s which sparked his interest in house and disco. “I was making music for years on my own in Chicago in Logic and not really getting very far”, he says, “Except for when I would do edits which I would send to my friends who were bigger DJs and they would love [them]”.<br/><br/>Foss claims that it was after meeting Jamie Jones in Ibiza in the early 2000s that changed his whole approach to music and laid the foundations for his later career.
