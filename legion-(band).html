            Legion is an American deathcore band from Columbus, Ohio currently signed to Good Fight Entertainment and eOne Music. Their debut album, Woke was released on July 30, 2013. The band has been said to use elements of heavy hardcore, beatdown, and metallic hardcore in their music with an emphasis of slowed-down riffs and guttural vocals similar to The Acacia Strain and Whitechapel.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The band formed together in 2009 playing shows in their hometown and writing for their first set of songs an EP titled This Is The End. After a year or so of playing these songs and developing a local fan base the band decided to release some new music. They would go on to release their new EP titled Bottom Feeder on September 29, 2010. The release of the EP was received well and was featured on a number of underground metal blogs that praised the young deathcore act on a stellar debut. With the new EP under their belts the band began to hit the road and played outside of Ohio for the first time playing shows with Like Moths To Flames, My Ticket Home, and For The Fallen Dreams.<br/><br/>In 2011 the band played a number of festivals such as New England Hardcore and Metal Fest, The JAMboree and Bled Fest. Tours began piling up as well now that the band had two EPs to play from as well as new material.
