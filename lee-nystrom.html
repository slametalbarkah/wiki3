<h1>Lee Nystrom</h1>
            
            Lee Allen Nystrom (born October 30, 1951) is an American former professional football player who was a  center in the National Football League (NFL). Nystrom was born on October 30, 1951, in Worthington, Minnesota, where he attended Worthington High School. After high school, he attended Macalester College where he played college football as an offensive lineman. During his time at Macalester, the team only won nine games over his four years.<br/><br/>Nystrom went undrafted in the 1973 NFL draft, although he signed a contract with the Pittsburgh Steelers as an undrafted free agent. Nystrom participated in the Steelers' preseason, including a victory against the Baltimore Colts. During the preseason, the Steelers also had him work on the defense. However, Nystrom was placed on the Steelers taxi squad prior to the start of the season. Later in the year, he was officially released, however the Steelers kept paying him with the hope of stashing him away from other teams. When the plan was revealed, the Steelers were fined $10,000 by the NFL and Nystrom signed with the Green Bay Packers.
